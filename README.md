# Snake Game on ARM-FITkit3

This project implements the classic Snake game on the ARM-FITkit3 platform as part of the IMP course. The game utilizes a 16x8 LED matrix display and user input through onboard buttons. It demonstrates handling GPIO, interrupts, and timer modules on an embedded system.

## Features

- Snake movement using directional buttons
- Apple placement and consumption logic
- Game-over detection (collision with self)
- 16x8 LED matrix visualization
- Periodic movement using PIT (Periodic Interrupt Timer)
